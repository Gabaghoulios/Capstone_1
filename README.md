# Google Capstone Project

## Purpose

This is the analysis of my Google Data Analytics Certification Capstone Project, offered through Coursera. 
The purpose of this project is to analyze rider habits for Cyclistic, a (fictional) Chicago-based bikeshare company that caters to bike riders with disabilities.
The Cyclistic marketing team wants to know rider habits for casual riders and annually paying members, each.
From the data provided, we will determine what steps will be taken for future marketing campaigns and maximizing annual membership.

2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to inuence casual riders to become members?
